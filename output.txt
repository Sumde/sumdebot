I found C to be eaiser than TI-Basic
Well the compilation date was before the artifice v2.0
They have done nothing but degrade their calculators
That's obvious
It can be improved a lot though
Better than nothing
My point was, was that when TI basically wipes out every single language from their calc because of some idiot using it to exploit or whatever, TI-Basic will always be here for us
I mean yeah I agree with that
You said it was useless so you kind of implied it
I don't see a use for it NOT existing
It's a nice gimmick to have then
Be honest guys would you like it if TI-Basic was removed from all calculators
Yep, I used it to code the classic snake game from a youtube tutorial
Because it's the only choice you have other than python for the python edition models
Kids aren't going to boot up their laptop, install TokenIDE, and send the .8xp file to the calc just to say hello world
Like what pat said
It's not a useless feature at all
You can get a lot done on it
You have to remember that they were also made for kids to learn programming
TI-Basic sucks but it is there for you when the world is collapsing
Don't tell me you forgot it

TI-84 Plus CE*
It's a TI-84 Plus with.. Some missing features
I'm probably absurdly wrong on this though, I haven't really used println() ever. ~~And when I do have to use it~~ (wait no, I don't)
Nothing wrong with println, it's just that I feel any programming language that has that as an option that people usually use, kinda sucks.
not using external libraries*
Oh. Didn't know that Java had multiple print functions 😅
Well main*
Any programming language that has println() as their print function sucks IMO.
I mean that's your opinion.
Which they are not all text based.
It's a visual programming language, I think the misunderstanding is that all programming languages are text based.
TBF AI wouldn't write 20k if statements

It's also as readable with braces.
I wouldn't call it bad code.

Hm, it's plugged in (I assume) and it doesn't find your calculator?

It gets bad when you use a church/school shooting to spread your political rhetoric.
We establish A republic.
No Republicans have fascism.
I HIGHLY doubt that the shooter would be a democrat, judging by previous church shootings.
Once again a lot of morons are saying stuff like "we need to kill the demoncrats" or whatever online.
I think it came from someone who disliked elephants.
I'm not even going to say "average day in America" anymore this is just sad.

You can sue the manufacturer if it causes damages.
I have a conspiracy theory that they are trying to brute force the accounts of random user's passwords and spam ads on it, as we have seen quite a lot of older accounts posting spam.

And everything else in a 30cm radius of that calculator had to be cleaned too just to be safe

Trying to see what you're talking about but now that I've stared at the "thanks" for too long it feels like it's not even a real word anymore.
Since pi is infinite, it contains all the information that will make it get sued, not only your social security number or info about you, but also threats, blueprints to the earths destruction, and more. (also if you laid out all the digits of pi on a piece of paper, it would become so massive until it turns into a blackhole that collapses the universe, resulting in septillions, maybe octillions of dollars)
No they're both 3.

Not for me. I was waiting in line for a ride on this roller coaster for about 2 hours with my family, but then I had to leave the line to go all the way back because I was critically dehydrated.
Can we agree that the worst part of a roller coaster is the long lines?

The only reason why that is, is because I look at the instructions, and I would say it's really easy to learn. But it's extremly hard to read. It takes a lot of time scrolling through all your instructions to find a bug or a mistake, and personally it's just eaiser to learn C.
I know what SOME of the instructions do, but I don't think I'll ever use them.
I still yet have to learn ez80.

We should start adding built in manuals to calculators <:thinkies:812723412388544523>
You're a senior??
That's just the "5" key on my CE.
Not if you install speakers or headphones.
Be careful, saying "dumb" is insulting to lots of people.
Probably just a web scraper. I made a video about the top 10,000 fries once.
TLM++
Probably broken CSS scaling on some devices.
Well not literally-
Adriweb# (# is just 4 plus's stacked on each other if you think about it, so it's double karma)
And this, I genuinely don't know why they added these constants.
PHP is the only language that can get away with doing this 😭
The only reason he did not get shot 64 times in the head is because he has the white privilege!
Censorship 💔
Isn't independence day about defeating fascism?
What about a 6080?
Nobody has the perfect political system 😢
No, not toronto.
Like northern Ontario.
Super close.
Wait, I'm in Canada so I do have a chance of seeing Omni...
I don't have to worry about anyone since I'm in Canada.
When you forget the Taylor series so you just graph it manually:
Yeah.
It's a blahaj
Crazy because I have one
Probably a Coffee shop <:thonk:799480726915514418>
Although my program wasn't meant to be optimized, I would be impressed if anyone made it worse.
That looks good as well 👍

WRong choise of words sorry
*I am not responsible for the demolition or destruction of your computer.*
Yes, it is pure C.
I hope my memory does not explode
Alr I finished.
Yes of course, this is definitely an integer!
Hmm, time to create a worse sum program!
What happens if B is negative?
I mean if your going to use only one of the functions (like sleep from time) then just import the function instead of the library because I assume (assuming because i'm not an expert at python) that importing the whole library would take up a lot of space instead of that one function.
I don't use that in headers, that is a no-brainer.
my stem teacher taught me that when I was 13 and ive used it ever since.
Not to be that person but may I ask why I've been taught to use that all my life and only now some nerd from a youtube video said it's bad so now I have to rewrite most of my code?
Is "using namespace std" a bad habit <:thonk:799480726915514418>
That seems so unexpected..

It's a minute difference, I can only see the colour being the difference.
The zen garden music is 🎉
The plants vs zombies
Probably just inline-documentation to show where certain JavaScript script bundles (I have no idea what the plural for JavaScript script bundels are) begin and end. Although I have to say that is kind of useless so I would not know exactly.
I will be excellent for the team 😭
That's so amazing.
Rule 200: Be Constructive! Help your fellow programmers by offering constructive feedback and criticism. Don't just tell them they're wrong, but instead explain and elaborate on the reasons.
Good morning.
Alright, thanks!
I wont say the link specifically cause I don't want kids to get flashed 😭
Yes, It is in the "history of cemetech" section.
That was probably a bit too much to say
But one of the links in the about section of Cemetech redirects to a p**n website.
I'm not sure if I should report this
Uhhh
They aren't in this server.
Ok but who is @1286803676211576853

That looks sick!

when da code so bad it got it saying "what"
well tbh she would have done the same thing
we should have elected kamala hairless :(
Well try to be careful of masked agents pulling you off the street.
"CALC" because cemetech is about calculators, not about just TI calcs
What's a what?
the stick figures in the loss
so its:
I  II
II L

Oh god...
No, I just noticed and though it would be funny to share it to everyone so the picture gets ruined.
Me too.
<:thonk:799480726915514418>
what are those bare hairy legs in the background
I just spent 2 days trying to solve a bug in my program and I was about to call off the feature but then I suddenly was like "what if we made a variable and then added to it instead of trying to calculate the X position each time", and somehow it worked...
why is coding so hard, there isn't any dynamic arrays in C 😣
Ahh, I see.
not that organ, the human organs
Organs 🤤😋
as long as nitro maybe
Best text editor ever
my fav is pencil and paper
I understand why but its just weird to me that a PHYSICAL calculator would do that
One of my calculators thinks 0.1+0.2 == 0.30000000004
working on a fractions program rn in c 😁
That's a great imagination
Don't ask how some people managed to do that without breaking all their bones
it was to test flexibility or whatever
